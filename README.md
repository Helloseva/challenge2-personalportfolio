## Description 

This personal portfolio page of mine was built as a requirenment of the bootcamp, Module 2. This is work in progress and some section will be added as the course progresses. The website has a header with links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. When the page is loaded the page presents my name, my recent photo and about me. Then my works section is presented which was built using Grid layout. When each of the project image clicked, then the user is taken to that deployed application. Since I have not yet done any projects the links are temporarily added. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.
